# A list of arcticles I have co-authored with Dr. Sukant Khurana and others.
---
**Please be advised that the articles I refer to have been re-edited since their first publication without consulting me. They may no longer articulate my personal views. I have not been associated with Dr. Khurana since Jan 2018, and do not associate myself with any of his personal views or undertakings. 
During my internship with Dr. Khurana, he was a scientist at the [Center for Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Drug Research Institute](https://cdri.res.in/). Shortly after my internship, he left the institute and undertook personal projects including a series of TEDx talks. I do not agree with his personal views and do not wish to be seen in association with him. 
During my internship, I learned a lot about AI and the philosophical arguments about ethics. I also honed my English-writing skills and that has been of immense help in my personal and professional work. I neither wish to discount my efforts nor Dr. Khurana's efforts in editing my original texts, therefore I haven't asked Dr. Khurana to take down the articles that I had co-authored. However, I shall not be responsible in any capacity for any harm the articles or Dr. Khurana's personal views bring to any individual or entity.**
