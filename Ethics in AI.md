# A list of articles I have co-authored with Dr. Sukant Khurana and others.

<br>

**Please be advised that the articles I refer to have been re-edited since their first publication by Dr. Khurana.** I have not been associated with [Dr. Khurana](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LiTpdBYAAAAJ) since Feb 2018, and do not identify with his personal views. During my internship with Dr. Khurana, he was a research scientist at the [Center for Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Drug Research Institute](https://cdri.res.in/). Shortly after my internship ended, he left the institute and undertook personal projects including a series of TEDx talks. I do not agree with his views in those videos.<br><br>During my internship, I learned a lot about AI and the philosophical arguments on ethics. I also honed my English-writing skills and that has been of immense help in my personal and professional work. I neither wish to discount my efforts nor Dr. Khurana's efforts in editing my original texts, therefore I haven't asked Dr. Khurana to take down the articles that I had authored. However, **I shall not be responsible in any capacity for any harm that Dr. Khurana's personal views bring to any individual or entity.**

Personally, I do not see AI from a lens of doom and gloom and do not subscribe to all the fearmongering. In the last few years, and specifically since the popularisation of ChatGTP, there has been a great furore. To me, AI represents a set of models that solve problems intelligently. There's nothing romantic or poetic about it. An excellent model---such as ChatGTP---does not automatically become an 'artificial general intelligence' (AGI) that beckons the end of humanity as we know it. AI is an incredibly handy tool that needs to be used with caution. Our models must be free of bias and ethically deployed. We need to understand our models better so that we don't misidentify, misattribute, and/or misuse them. Nefarious actors will always exist, however, for every [black hat](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_hat_(computer_security)) there's a [white hat](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/White_hat_(computer_security)). ðŸ™ƒ
